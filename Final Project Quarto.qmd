## Importing Database 1:

#### This study examines 394 globally recognized digital games (1972â€“2020) to assess how mental health is represented, using expert and documental analysis. It categorizes content based on DSM-V disorders and evaluates perceptions from players and scientific literature.

```{r}
database_1 <- read.csv("listagem games- tania-bks-TaniaRibeiro.csv")
sample_n(database_1, 6) 
```

## Importing Database 2:
```{r}

```


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
